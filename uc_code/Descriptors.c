  This firmware enumerates as a vendor-class device meaning
  the developer must decide and code a communication scheme.
  Examples of arbitrary endpoint as well as control endpoint
  communication are given.
  Search for TODO statements for implementation hints.
  Avoid busy loops as the USB task is not preemptive and USB
  has timing contraints.  Use concurrent programming techniques.
  For example, have one function set a flag when an event occurs.
  Have another function do significant processing only if the flag is set.
  Have both functions run from main()'s for(;;) loop, which should be the
  only indefinite loop in your firmware.
